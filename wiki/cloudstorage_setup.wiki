== Introduction ==

[http://owncloud.org ownCloud] is a service deployed on the WCRL cluster enabling _automatic synchronization_ of files between _cluster home directories_ and _personal devices_.

This functionality can be convenient when using WebCML on the cluster.

ownCloud usage requires a cluster account.  Contact the system administrator to obtain one if necessary.


== Procedure for Enabling Cluster ownCloud Access ==

*1. Access Request*
    Contact the system administrator and request access to ownCloud.
    Once a reply has been received, proceed to the next step.  


*2. Configuration on Cluster*

   In this step we create a directory on the cluster under your home directory to synchronize with the WCRL ownCloud server.

  Log in via SSH and execute

   {{{
       > sudo wcrl-owncloud-setup
   }}}

   Enter your WCRL cluster password when prompted.

   Your cluster home directory will contain a new directory
   {{{
       ~/oc
   }}}
    which contains all files synchronized to your ownCloud account.


*3. Client installation*

   On the machine to be synchronized with your cluster ownCloud directory, download and install the _ownCloud Desktop client_ for your platform located at

https://owncloud.org/install/


*4. Client configuration*

Launch the desktop client.  When prompted for a server address, enter
{{{ 
https://wcrl.csee.wvu.edu/owncloud 
}}}
as
