Notation:
> denotes a command ran on MySQL server.
>> denotes a Linux command.
<<sometext>> denotes text that need to be replaced by MySQL root password.

Requirements:
1. Linux OS (e.g. Debian)
2. Tomcat 5.5 and Apache installed
3. MySQL server 5.1.49 istalled 
4. MySQL database ".sql" file (e.g., wctcdb.sql)
5. Web application deployment files (e.g., "wctc" directory)

================== Data base ======================

I Data base

A. Data base creation

1. Copy the file "wctcdb.sql" (available in svn repository: pcs/wi/db) to your home directory on the cluster.
2. Log in to the cluster using SSH.
3. While in your home directory, run the following command to log in to the sql server:
   (You'll need to run this command from the same directory which contains the .sql file)

	>> mysql -u root -p

4. You'll be prompted for a root password.
5. To load the database file, type:

	> source wctcdb.sql;
   (This command creates the necessary tables and routines)

6. To view databases on the server:

	> show databases;

   Database "wctcdb" should be listed.



B. Data base creation and restoration with existing data dump

1. Copy the file "wctcdb_dump.sql" (latest data base dump as of 05/14/2013: available in my home directory /home/abommaga/webapp_wctc/database/) to your home directory on the cluster.
2. Log in to the cluster using SSH.
3. While in your home directory, run the following command to log in to the sql server:
   (You'll need to run this command from the same directory which contains the .sql file)

	>> mysql -u root -p

4. You'll be prompted for a root password.
5. Run the following command to create "wctcdb" database (if "wctcdb" data base does not already exist on MySQL server):

	> CREATE DATABASE wctcdb;

6. To load the database dump file, type:

	> source wctcdb_dump.sql;
    (This command creates the necessary tables, routines, and loads tables with existing data)

7. To view databases on the server:

	> show databases;

   Database "wctcdb" should be listed.


C. Creating a data dump

1. Log in to the cluster using SSH.
2. Run the following command to take backup of data base (wctcdb) required for "wctc" web application:

	>> mysqldump --routines --user=root --password=<<password>>  wctcdb > wctcdb_dump.sql  

   (You'll need to replace <<password>> with "root" password of MySQL)

3. This will generate a file "wctcdb_dump.sql" in your current working directory.
4. This file can be used to create data tables, routines, and to restore data of "wctcdb" data base.


================== Web application ======================

II Web application

1. Copy the directory "wctc" (available in svn repository pcs/wi/GenericWebApp/war) to your home directory on the cluster.
2. Database connection values in the file "DBConnectionConstants.properties" (available in svn repository pcs/wi/GenericWebApp/war/wctc/WEB-INF/classes) are removed for security reasons.
3. Log in to the cluster using SSH.
4. Replace "DBConnectionConstants.properties" (available in pcs/wi/GenericWebApp/war/wctc/WEB-INF/classes) file with the file of the same name available in my home directory at /home/abommaga/webapp_wctc/database/
5. While in your home directory, run the following command to deploy web application files (i.e., directory "wctc") to Tomcat "webapps" (make sure you have execution rights for ‘wcrl-tc-deployapp’ script):

	>> wcrl-tc-deployapp wctc
   (You'll be prompted for your password.)
   This will copy "wctc" directory to Tomcat ‘webapps’ directory and then restart the Tomcat server, deploying the application.

6. To be able to access users' job files by the web application, run the following command:

	>> sudo ln -s /home/ /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/wctc/
   This will create a soft link to "/home/" directory.

7. Run the following command to change the ownership and group of the directory created using sym link to be owned by user "tomcat6" and group "tomcat-dev":

	>> sudo chown -R tomcat6:tomcat-dev /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/wctc1/home

9. Open a web browser and point to "http://wcrl.csee.wvu.edu/wctc/". You should be able to view web interface login page.
